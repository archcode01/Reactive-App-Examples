# Reactive-App-Examples
This repo has Spring reactive examples, Spring Imperative REST API implementations, Spring WebClient and load test scripts

This repo is forked from https://github.com/2013techsmarts/Spring-Reactive-Examples.
The idea was to add other reactive applications on the similar lines as that of spring examples in orignal repo and compare the performance.
Using the same load test framework that of Gatling and similar test on different endpoints backed by different techstacks.
I have added Quarkus application which has endpoints which is reactive and other a regular one. 

I will add the load test results of each module here. 
But by far the reactive applications perform way better than non reactive.
